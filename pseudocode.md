## Build-up for project
```
What do we want to display on our restaurant site?
 - Need a header with content 
    -Restaurant title : Le Roux Effronté
    -Address : 348 East Main Street Lexington, KY
    -Hours of Operation: 11a-8p
 - Accordions displaying menu items
    -Size and position : I want 2 accordions above and 2 accordions below.
    - Default page load: All accordions closed, can visually see all 4 on one page.
    - Stretch goal for accordions, only have one displayed on page that can rotate when a specific button is clicked
    - While any top accordions are open, lets have bottom auto close to adjust for sizing issues?
    - Lets have 4 accordions
        - Appetizer
