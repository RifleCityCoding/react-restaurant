What do we want to display on our restaurant site?

 - Need a header with content 

    -Restaurant title : Le Roux Effronté

    -Address : 348 East Main Street Lexington, KY

    -Hours of Operation: 11a-8p

 - Accordions displaying menu items

    -Size and position : We want 2 accordions above and 2 accordions below.

    - Background picture of a dining room, cafe maybe?

    - Lets shoot for a different header look as not to blend too much with background of accordions

    - Do we want accordions to be clear and show background behind or have their own coloring?

    - Default page load: All accordions closed, can visually see all 4 on one page.

    - Stretch goal for accordions, only have one displayed on page that can rotate when a specific button is clicked

    - While any top accordions are open, lets have bottom auto close to adjust for sizing issues?

    -Maybe adding a randomizer for when each accordion is closed it changes the options?

    - Lets have 4 accordions

        - Appetizer
        
        - Brunch
         
        - Entreé
          
        - Drinks

           ```
